# Unscramble

This simple game project inspired from unscramble game.

_The goal of the game is: given a set of related but scrambled words to reorder them_

The idea is to use a more complex project than a simple
hello world or to-do list app to compare the different
front-end web frameworks.
The comparison will be carried out on the web frameworks of my interest to have a better view of how is developing with them as
an experience.

## MVP

A user can start a new game and need to reorder the scrambled words one by one, until it guessed all.

# Outcome

Below is my opinion on development with the following web frameworks.

## Svelte

### Start up

To start with it is very easy thanks to the great documentation and CLI experience.

## React

### Start up

To work with react only is not easy as the documentation itself suggest to start with a react-powered framework (meta-framework).
This isn't a bad thing, but if we want to learn react not the framework approach over it isn't a good start. 
I would like to start with the basic of react not of a complex system when learning the main concepts of a library.
It's true that React as an focused UI library so it's not fully fledged web framework, so we need other libraries to work with it.
However starting with next.js for example we will have a different experience from Remix or Gatsby. 
It's true that is a sandbox option to try react directly online
and a suggested approach to configure local project by copying the sandbox. I didn't find it so useful and easy. 
It was easier to start a local react project with old documentation.
